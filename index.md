My name is Tobias Grether. I'm 19 years old and live in Germany, where I study Computer Science at the RWTH Aachen University.

I was introduced to software development through the game Minecraft, which has turned from a hobby to a part-time job for me. For me, the simple voxel game is a great playground to expirement with different technologies and frameworks and expand my knowledge.

My primary focus is Infrastructure Development with Kubernetes & Containerd as well as back-end development and I've done that job for over three years now.

This is a very niche area, so there are not many resources around to guide new people to the topic, which is why I created this blog. Here I will try to dive deep into technical topics surrounding Backend and Infrastructure on the use case of Minecraft servers.
